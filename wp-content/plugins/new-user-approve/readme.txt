Running a WordPress site is exciting but it also means you’re constantly battling spam registrations, fake accounts, and unwanted users. New User Approve works as a default WordPress registration system that does not let anyone sign up and instantly gain access. Because its your responsibility as a site owner as exactly who’s allowed into your site before any user log in.

New User Approve comes is a powerful WordPress user approval plugin that puts you in full control of your community, membership site, online store, or private portal. With this manual user approval plugin, you can moderate user registration, protect your content, and keep your website free from unwanted registration requests.
Whether you want to restrict user access before approval, prevent fake user signups, or simply make sure every new member is legit, New User Approve makes it easy, professional, and efficient. 

==⭐ Why You Need New User Approve ⭐==
Imagine running a membership site, community forum, or private business portal where quality and security matter. The last thing you want is spam bots flooding your database or strangers sneaking into confidential areas.

**New User Approve helps** you:
⚡ **Stop spam registrations** and fake accounts before they ever log in
⚡ **Verify user identities** by reviewing each signup manually
⚡ Maintain **complete control** over who becomes part of your community
⚡ Create a **safe, trusted space** for your members or customers

Unlike generic WordPress plugins that simply hide login pages, New User Approve adds a true **user verification before approval** process. It gives you confidence to grow your site without worrying about who’s lurking behind those new user accounts. 
  
==🛠 How It Works==
Here’s how **New User Approve**, your go-to **member approval plugin**, transforms your registration flow:

When someone registers on your WordPress site, you’ll receive an email alert. You can then decide to approve or deny their account. The plugin automatically emails the user to let them know the outcome.

👁If approved, the user receives their login details and can access your site immediately.
👁If denied, they’ll be kept out—and can’t even log in.
👁Pending users stay locked out until you make a decision.

This makes it simple to **restrict user access before approval** and ensure only the right people become part of your online community.

Already have users on your website? No problem. 

Existing users stay approved automatically when you install New User Approve. You can also change someone’s approval status at any time, with easy search tools for managing pending, approved, or denied users.

==⌛ Save Time with Zapier Automation==
Want to work smarter? Connect **New User Approve** to Zapier to automate routine tasks.
For example:

* Trigger a Slack message when a user is approved
* Add approved users to a Google Sheet
* Send emails through Gmail when someone’s denied

With Zapier, you can integrate the plugin with thousands of apps without writing a single line of code. It’s perfect for businesses looking to streamline their processes while maintaining strict **user verification before approval.**
 
==🤝 Invite Trusted Users Instantly==
Sometimes you want trusted people—like staff, VIPs, or clients—to skip the approval queue. With New User Approve’s invitation codes, you can:

* 📜 Generate unique codes manually or automatically
* 💳 Give those codes to users so they’re **auto-approved** upon registration
* 💻 Manage, edit, or disable codes anytime
* 🛒 Seamlessly integrate codes with WooCommerce registrations

This feature makes it easier than ever to onboard important members without sacrificing security.
 
==☀ A Fresh New Interface==
**New User Approve** has been redesigned with a crisp, modern look that’s clean and user-friendly. The updated interface is intuitive for admins and gives users confidence in your website’s professionalism.
